Algorithm Highlights
Falcon offers the following features:

Security: a true Gaussian sampler is used internally, which guarantees negligible leakage of information on the secret key up to a practically infinite number of signatures (more than 264).
Compactness: thanks to the use of NTRU lattices, signatures are substantially shorter than in any lattice-based signature scheme with the same security guarantees, while the public keys are around the same size.
Speed: use of fast Fourier sampling allows for very fast implementations, in the thousands of signatures per second on a common computer; verification is five to ten times faster.
Scalability: operations have cost O(n log n) for degree n, allowing the use of very long-term security parameters at moderate cost.
RAM Economy: the enhanced key generation algorithm of Falcon uses less than 30 kilobytes of RAM, a hundredfold improvement over previous designs such as NTRUSign. Falcon is compatible with small, memory-constrained embedded devices.
